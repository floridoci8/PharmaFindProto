# PharmaFindProto
PharmaFind prototype

A prototype project for the jacobsHack! 2018 hackathon, where in 24 hours we had to come up with a project and finalize it.

The idea was to make an app, which had a database of pharmacies, their addresses, and the medicined and drugs available in each of them.
This would be updated by the pharmacies themselves in the future, but for the hackathon's purposes we made a small mock database using PHP, and a website using HTML and CSS. 

In this app the user would be able to look up a certain drug and they would receive the closest pharmacies which had it in stock.
